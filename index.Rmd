## Many Americans' views are systematically underrepresented in political polling and academic research.

```

This is especially true for Americans who consider themselves right wing, identify with the alt right, or don't think about their political views on a simple left-right, liberal-conservative spectrum.
  
In the **Political Pathways Project**, we want to paint a more complete picture of political opinions in the United States.  To do so, we are recruiting **people like you** to join our paid research studies.
